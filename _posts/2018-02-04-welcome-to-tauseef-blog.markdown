# Who am I?
Hi, I am `Ali`, a *Analytics Professional* and a *Smart Home Hacker & Technology Junkie* from Chico, CA who loves to solve complex problems help businesses succeed with their goals. 

$$\int {2{h^4} - 1} $$

I was born in Southern California, and have lived all over the west coast.  I finished up my schooling near my grandparent's ranch and was a horse foreman for many years during the day, and a hacker at night.  I completed my courses of study in Business Management and Environmental Science from [CSU, Chico][csu-chico] and graduated in 2009.

I have over a decade of experience with web development, and only a few years experience with R, Python, Ruby, VBA- among other languages as well..

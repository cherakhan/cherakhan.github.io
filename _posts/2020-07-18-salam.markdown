1. Open ***Git Bash*** (not cmd !) 

2. Go to your ***local directory*** that you want to clone the repository from ***new account*** 

3. ***Clone*** the new repository

   ```
   $ https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
   ```

   now you have cloned your new repository. To check if it has been cloned or not

   ```
   $ ls
   ```

4. List your existing remotes in order to get the name of the remote you want to change.

   ```
   $ git remote -v
   origin  git@hostname:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
   origin  git@hostname:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)
   ```

5. Change your remote's URL from SSH to HTTPS with the `git remote set-url` command (only need to change `USERNAME` and `PROJECTNAME`)

   ```
   $ git config --local credential.https://github.com.user1 user1
   $ git config --local credential.useHttpPath true
   $ git config --local credential.helper manager
   $ git remote set-url origin https://USERNAME@github.com/USERNAME/PROJECTNAME.git
   ```

6. Verify that the remote URL has changed (here you would see the new `USERNAME`)

   ```
   $ git remote -v
   # Verify new remote URL
   origin  https://USERNAME@github.com/USERNAME/PROJECTNAME.git (fetch)
   origin  https://USERNAME@github.com/USERNAME/PROJECTNAME.git (push)
   ```

7. Pull request

   ```
   $ git pull origin master
   ```

8. add you documents and then `git add`

   ```
   $ git add --all
   ```

9. commit

   ```
   $ git commit -m "comment"
   ```

10. Push 

    ```
    $ git push origin master
    ```

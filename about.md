<p>
I am currently a Web & Marketing Analytics Specialist at <a href="https://www.build.com" target="_blank">Build.com</a>. I also operate as an Analyst using various premium toolsets as well as open-source tools.  I love to retrieve data, and wrangle it- and provide insights not otherwise possible without the skills behind the craft.  I frequently share my oontent on youtube and LinkedIn, so make sure to take a look at everything I have to offer online. I like to solve complex problems, as well as build off of and improve complex algorythms.  My favorite areas of interest include- Visualizations and Story-Telling with Datasets, API connection, Machine Learning, Marketing Attribution, and joining online with offline transactional data.

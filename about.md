<p>
Hi, I am <code>Ali</code>, a <i>Data Analyst</i> and <i>Biomedical Engineer</i> from Iran, who is interested in the application of mathematics in biology and loves to contribute in clinical trials using T cells.
<p>

<h1 style="font-size:20px;; color:orange"># Bachelor</h1>
<p>
I finished my bachelor's degree in <i>Petroleum Engineering</i> at <i>Petroleum University of Technology</i>. Although I had published several papers and gained experience in mathematical modeling and machine learning, I was not interested in oil :) . After graduation, I decided to learn about stem cells, which was/is a hot topic in Iran, and joined <code>Dr. Naser Ahmadbeigi</code>'s Lab at <i>Digestive Disease Research Institute</i>, Shariati Hospital. I was trained in mesenchymal stromal cells for about 8 months.
<p>


<h1 style="font-size:20px;; color:orange"># Master</h1>
<p>
For my master's degree, I moved to  <i>Memorial University of Newfoundland</i> , St. Johns, where I began my work on genome-scale metabolic modeling of microorganisms under the supervision of <code>Dr. Sohrab Zendehboudi</code>.
<p>


<h1 style="font-size:20px;; color:orange"># PhD</h1>
<p>
In 2018, I joined <code>Dr. Jamie Piret</code>'s lab as a PhD student and also co-supervised by <code>Dr. Bhushan Gopaluni</code> at <i>University of British Columbia</i>. My project is on T cell manufacturing for clinical trials. For this project, I use machine learning, mathematical modeling along with conducting experiments in the lab.

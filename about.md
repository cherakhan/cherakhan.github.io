# Who am I?
Hi, I am `Ali`, a *Data Analyst* and a *Biomedical Engineer* from Iran, who is interested in application of mathematics in biology and and loves to contribute in clinical trials using T cells. 

I was born in Varayeneh,a village from Nahavand city.  

#### Bachelor
I finished my bachelor in *Petroleum Engineering* at *Petroleum University of Technology*. Altough I had published several papers and gained experience in mathematical modeling and machine learning, I was not entusuasted by oil!.
After graduation I decided to learn about * Stem cells* which was/is a hot topic in Iran and contacted a `Dr. Naser Ahmadbeigi` at *Tehran University of Medical Sciences* and asked him to let me join his lab at *Digestive Disease Research Institute*. I was trained for almost 8 months on mesyncymal stromal cells.   

#### Master
For my master degree, I moved to *Memorial University of Newfoundland* , St. Johns where I started working on genome-scale metabolic modeling of micrororganisms under suprvision of `Dr. Sohrab Zendehboudi`.

#### PhD
In 2018, I joined `Dr. Jamie Piret` lab as a PhD student at University of British Columbia. My project is on T cell manufacturing for clinical trail. For this project, I use machine learning, mathematical modeling along dong experiment in the lab.

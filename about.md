<h1 style="font-size:20px;; color:orange"># Who am I?</h1>
<p>
Hi, I am <code>Ali</code>, a <i>Data Analyst</i> and a <i>Biomedical Engineer</i> from Iran, who is interested in application of mathematics in biology and and loves to contribute in clinical trials using T cells. 
<p>

<h1 style="font-size:20px;; color:orange"># Bachelor</h1>
<p>
I finished my bachelor in <i>Petroleum Engineering</i> at <i>Petroleum University of Technology</i>. Altough I had published several papers and gained experience in mathematical modeling and machine learning, I was not entusuasted by oil!.
After graduation I decided to learn about <i> Stem cells</i> which was/is a hot topic in Iran and contacted a <code>Dr. Naser Ahmadbeigi</code> at <i>Tehran University of Medical Sciences</i> and asked him to let me join his lab at <i>Digestive Disease Research Institute</i>. I was trained for almost 8 months on mesyncymal stromal cells.

<h1 style="font-size:20px;; color:orange"># Master</h1>
<p>
For my master degree, I moved to <i>Memorial University of Newfoundland</i> , St. Johns where I started working on genome-scale metabolic modeling of micrororganisms under suprvision of <code>Dr. Sohrab Zendehboudi</code>.
<p>


<h1 style="font-size:20px;; color:orange"># PhD</h1>
<p>
In 2018, I joined <code>Dr. Jamie Piret's</code> lab as a PhD student and am co-supervised by <code>Dr. Bhushan Gopaluni</code> at University of British Columbia. My project is on T cell manufacturing for clinical trail. For this project, I use machine learning, mathematical modeling along dong experiment in the lab.
